# M3U Parser

An M3U file parser written in Rust. This was designed as a take-home assignment

To build, you must have Rust installed (instructions for installing can be found
[here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)). Simply run ```cargo run -- <args>```,
where args are the arguments you'd like to pass to the program. To see a full list of
